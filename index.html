At the beginning of the year, Student A, did not want to do his work and would, when given instructions, go on an anger rant where he would shout ant threw chairs. This happened at least twice every week. He took up valuable class time and made my other students feel very scared and uncomfortable. A collogue of mine, which works at a different school told me about S.E.E.D.S. and how it impacted her children. I went it the website and started looking into their strategies in trying it find the root of the problem and after two moths of taking the time, abiding by the strategies, he opened up to the circumstances of his abusive household. He now obtains a steady average between 65% and 75% and will be moving on the next grade, after he did not pass his first or second term. Thank you S.E.E.D.S.</p><p><span class="image right"><img src="images/person2.jpg" alt=""></span><b>Taboka Ndlovu</b><br>I am a math teacher and this occurrence seemed to happen every second day with a student in her class. The child proceeds the to do the exacts same work, done on the ripped our page and dis causes not only as waste in class time, but makes the rest of the students impatient as they need to wait. We have talked with her parents and it seems to be a constant habit since she started school, but only in math. I went to S.E.E.D.S., as many of my collogues use it, and by using their resources, we could identify that she suffers from the emotional barrier, OCD. We helped her by using the available strategies given on the website. This learner was learnt methods on how to manage her OCD and what the source of her OCD was, and it has been a month since she has ripped out a page!</p><p><span class="image left"><img src="images/person3.jpg" alt=""></span><b>Garrot Williams</b><br>One of the learners in my class can’t seem to stay awake for the entire duration of my class and he does this in most of his other classes as well. He loses out on many class activities and when trying to contact his parents, regarding the issue there is no response or answer. I started to worry, because due to this, his marks started do decline and he is a smart learner student. I turned to S.E.E.D.S for help, as no one knew how to approach the situation. We started asking questions with regards to his actions, as mentioned on the website and got to the root of the problem. The child was malnourished and struggled to obtain his energy in a classroom environment. By using S.E.E.D.S resources, we could come into contact with a NGO that helped provide the student with the needed care to have a well-nourished mind and body when entering the classroom.</p></div><a href="#three" class="goto-next scrolly">Next</a></div></section><section id="three" class="main special"><div class="container"><span class="image fit primary"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt=""></span><div class="content"><header class="major"><h2>Resources</h2></header><p>At SEEDS, we are committed to providing valuable resources because we firmly believe that equipping teachers with the necessary tools is essential in overcoming emotional and social learning barriers in classrooms.
